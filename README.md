# Sentimental Scraper

Uses Python and the Twitter API (via tweepy) to determine popular sentiment by analyzing tweets. Creates a matplotlib graph comparing positive and negative sentiment.

The dataset used to determine positive and negative sentiment words can be found here. https://github.com/abdulfatir/twitter-sentiment-analysis/tree/master/dataset. Special thanks to github user abdulfatir. 

Requires tweepy to interface with Twitter API, and MatPlotLib to display results.
